Welcome to the GitHub Tutorial.  It is important to keep up with the new computer services being 
offered in todayâ€™s high tech world.  Most of you are familiar with Box or DropBox accounts.  These 
services allows one to upload and download files, share files between users, and modify files without 
losing formatting or content.  From a very basic understanding, GitHub functions in the same manner, 
except GitHub helps maintain the format of the code for many different coding languages.  The GitHub 
service allows uploading and downloading codes, sharing the code between users, and modifying the 
codes without losing formatting or content.  

Technically, GitHub Inc. is a hosting service on the web.  It uses Git, which is the command window.  
GitHub allows bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
